| [`dec82`](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-bracket/blob/main/designs/dec82.md), uses [grove](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/) parts. | [`dec82q`](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-bracket/blob/main/designs/dec82q.md), uses [qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) parts. |

To install the software, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli/wiki/Raspberry-Pi) to set up a headless Raspberry Pi w/ [`abcli`](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli) enabled. Then. in your development environment, open a terminal and type in,

```bash
# dev
abcli ssh rpi <rpi-hostname>

# rpi
abcli cookie copy dec82q # or dec82
abcli init

sudo raspi-config
# Interface Options -> Camera -> Yes
# Interface Options -> I2C -> Yes
# Interface Options -> SSH -> Yes
# System Options -> Boot / Auto Login -> Console Autologin
# if dec82q: Advanced Options -> Overscan -> No
# if dec82q: Interface Options -> SPI -> Yes
# Reboot.
```
